# MMaps : Modular Finite Maps overs Ordered Types

This repository contains several implementations of finite maps over
arbitrary ordered types using Coq functors. This is an udpdated version of
Coq Stdlib's FMaps. It is meant to complement the MSet library.

As a starting point, you may consider [MMaps.Interface] and [MMaps.demo].

**Caveat** : This is work-in-progress, and mights still change in the future,
including `MMaps.Interface`. This is open source : patches, questions,
comments are most welcome !
