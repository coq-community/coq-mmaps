synopsis: Several implementations of finite maps over arbitrary ordered types using Coq functors

description: |-
  This project contains several implementations of finite maps,
  including implementations based on AVL trees and red-black trees.
  The finite maps are parameterized on arbitrary ordered types using
  Coq functors. This is an updated version of the Coq Stdlib's FMaps
  that is meant to complement the Stdlib's MSet library.

  ## Documentation

  This library of finite maps is a modernization of
  [FMaps](https://coq.inria.fr/stdlib/Coq.FSets.FMaps.html) in Coq's
  standard library.
  Compared to FMaps, MMaps has a richer interface and provides additional
  finite map implementations, including a performant implementation
  [based on red-black trees](theories/RBT.v).

  As starting points for understanding how to use the library,
  we recommend looking at [MMaps.Interface](theories/Interface.v) and
  [MMaps.demo](theories/demo.v).
