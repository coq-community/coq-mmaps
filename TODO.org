* TODO opam package, see :
** https://coq.inria.fr/opam-packaging.html
** https://github.com/coq-community/manifesto

* TODO extra ops 
** DONE filter + partition + for_all + exists
** DONE singleton
** split ?
** min_binding, max_binding, choose ?
** remove_min, remove_max ?
** update (The one of OCaml, mixing find + add/remove)
** gmerge (as already in AVL) ? unsure
** mapo (from AVL and RBT) ?
** common merge instance, such as diff, inter, union ? Cf Facts
** of_list = fold add, of_sorted_list (cf treeify in RBT) ?

* DONE add_cardinal_2 (cf PR Coq)
** DONE SameKeys another equivalence on maps (on keys only) --> here named Eqdom

* DONE short filenames (MMap.Interface au lieu de MMapInterface)

* TODO improve demo.v
** DONE Why ZM.Raw.key appears in Print map3 : "Definition key" was too early in Raw.Pack
** TODO do we want ZM.key or Z ? How to choose ? Weird : R.key becomes Z, not ZM.key ?!
** TODO R.empty without implicit elt ?
** TODO type of Mkt ?
** TODO test demo.v and Coq 8.11
** TODO avoid printing message during compilation ?

* TODO Maps on unit + Eqdom --> an MSets implementation
** Issue : compare on sets ?

* DONE : dilute Sord inside S, with a compare taking a elt_compare as argument ?
** DONE improve generic implem in AVL, RBT
** DONE improve generic implem in Positive
** DONE args order in equal_spec vs. compare_spec
** DONE facts : from compare_spec to compare_sym, compare_trans, StrictOrder, etc
** DONE Maps as OrderedTypes ?

* TODO fix weird specs like merge_spec1 (?)

* TODO unified spec of add and remove based on some key_eqb (cf. add_o) ?
** Not ideal since DecidableType K have K.eq_dec, not K.eqb

* TODO AVL.gmerge could start by comparing height (better have the little map on the right)

* TODO RBT could have ins_below, join, split, and merge via split+join ?
** check complexity in this case ?

* DONE module AVLproofs with AVL invariant proofs
* DONE module RBTproofs with RedBlack invariant proofs

* DONE Interface Raw and module Raw.Pack
** Btw : why no need for apply ok in Raw.Pack.bindings_spec2 ??!!

* TODO provide a MultiSets.v (and update it), cf Fset contrib

* TODO document the expected complexities

* TODO test extraction

* DONE Reorganisation GenTree
** DONE better name for the T module
** DONE put MapsTo just after, instead of at the very end of (AVL/RBT).MakeRaw
** DONE directly use In0 instead of two version (inductive vs exists) ?

* DONE warnings in Coq 8.11
** DONE Hints not in core
